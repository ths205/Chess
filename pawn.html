<p>The pawn is for the most part the weakest piece of all the other pieces. Each player has 8 pawns in the beginning of the game. A pawn is initially able to move two spaces forward vertically at the start of each game but is subsequently allowed to move 1 space forward vertically.  If the pawn successfully reaches the opposite side of the board then the pawn is promoted to a knight, bishop, rook, or queen.
  
  The pawn had its origins in Chaturanga, and is still present in other versions of the game.  These pieces were used as a metaphor for the common man.
  In medieval chess, each pawn was given the name of each occupation from left to right:
  
  Gambler or messenger(in the left-most file)
  City guard or policeman(in front of the knight)
  Innkeeper(in front of the bishop)
  Merchant/Moneychanger(in front of the king, whether or not the piece is to the left or right of the queen, depends on the color of the pieces)
  Doctor(is always the queen's pawn)
  Weaver/Clerk (in front of the bishop, for whom they wove or clericked)
  Blacksmith (in front of the knight as they cared the horses)
  Worker/farmer(in front of a castle, for which they worked) </p>
