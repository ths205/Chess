<p>The Queen is the most powerful piece in the game, being able to move any number of squares diagonally, vertically and horizontally. Each player has one queen in the beginning of each game.  The piece is positioned next to their king.  The white queen starts off in the white square and the black queen starts in the black square.  
  
  In the game shatranj(precursor to chess), the queen  was a weak piece called vizier. The vizier is only able to capture on square in a diagonal similar to a pawn. In 1300 its move was enhanced to jump two squares diagonally. For a while it was allowed to move like a knight once in a game. This rule was used in Turkey and Russia until the 18th Century.
  
  According to the Historian Marilyn Yalom, the prominence of medieval queens such as Elenor of Aquitaine and Blanche of Castile, and the cult of the Virgin Mary, might have been partially responsible  for influencing the piece(vizier) towards its identity as the queen, and its extraordinary power on the board.  
  
  Before the queen's powers expanded, it was already described as essential to the king's survival, so when the queen was gone there was nothing more of important value. During the 16th century the queen took its modern form as the move of the rook and the bishop. This new version of chess was called queen's chess spread throughout Europe due to the printing press and the popularity of books on chess.  It also faced plenty of controversy that ranged from anxiety over a powerful female warrior piece, to abuse against women.
  
  There was also a restriction against promoting a pawn as a queen while there was a queen on the board to avoid further scandal over the existence of more than one queen. </p>
