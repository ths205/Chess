<h3>Pin</h3>

<p><a name="pin">A pin is created by attacking another piece such that if
the attacked piece moves out of the way it would lead to the 
capture of a more valuable piece. There are two types of pins
in chess are absolute pin and relative pin. 
The absolute pin is the piece behind the pinned
piece is a king, then the pinned piece cannot move out of the way
because it is not allowed to put one's own king in check. 
The relative pin is if the pinned piece does move out of its way 
leading to the capture of a more valuable piece.The picture
below is an example.</a></p>
