<p>The king is the most important piece in the game. As stated in the introduction the purpose is to trap the king so that the piece does
  not have anymore moves to make without being captured. Although it is the most important, it is also the weakest piece.  The king is able to move one
  space whether it would be diagonally,horizontally, or vertically unless the space the king moves would place it in check.  The king is able to perform a move called castling, where the moves two squares toward the rook, and the rook is placed on the other side of the King. Castling ,however, occurs when neither 
  the king or castle has previously moved, when no squares have been previously occupied, and when the king is not in check.
