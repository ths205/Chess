<p>Is a piece that is able to move any number of squares of diagonally. There are two bishops at the beginning of each game. The bishop can capture a piece by occupying by occupying a square where the enemy piece sits.  The bishops can be differentiated by which wing they begin on. As a result each bishop remains on either the white or black squares.
  
  The bishop's predecessor in shatranji was the alfil, which mean elephant, which could leap two squares along any diagonal, and could jump over an intervening piece.  As a result, each alfil was restricted to eight squares, and no alfil could attack another.  The bishop appeared shortly after 1200 C.E in Courier chess.
  
  The term "bishop" entered the English language in the 16th century, with the first known example that dates back to the 1560s.. In other Germanic languages, except Icelandic, it is called different names, all of which translates to "messenger". In Icelandic ,however, is called a "biskup" with the same definition as in English.  It is interesting that the use of the term predates the English language, as the first mention of the term dates back to the 14th century. In the Saga of Earl Magus, it is described how an emperor was checked mated by a bishop, which has led to some speculation over the origin of the term "bishop".
  
  The canonical chessman dates back to 1849. The piece's  deep groove symbolizes  a bishop's mitre. The groove originates from an elephant with the grooves that represented the elephants tusks. The British chose to call the piece the bishop because the projections at the top resemble a mitre. The groove was interpreted differently as the game moved to Europe.
