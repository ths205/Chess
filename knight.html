<p>The knight is equal in strength to the bishop.  It also has the distict advantage of being able to jump over other pieces.  When it moves it can move
  two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one horizontally.  The knight is especially useful when executing a fork against any of the opponents pieces excpet for another knight. </p>
