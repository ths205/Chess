<h2><a name="check">Check</a></h2>

<p>Is when the player's king is under attack with a check but is able to get out of the check.  A king can get out of check in three ways: 
The first is by moving one space in any direction that would get the king out of check. The second is for another piece to interpose itself between the attacking piece and the king.  The third would be to capture the attacking.
